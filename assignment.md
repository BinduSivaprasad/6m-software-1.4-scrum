## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

Implementing Scrum can significantly enhance an IT team's productivity 

By introducing structured, iterative processes, defining clear roles that improve organization and focus.

Scrum is a framework that divides projects into manageable chunks called sprints, typically lasting two to four weeks. 

This allows teams to deliver small, incremental updates rather than waiting until the end of a long development cycle.

Each sprint involves 
1. planning
2. execution
3. review phases
which helps in setting clear, short-term goals and regularly assessing progress.

The Scrum framework includes specific roles each with distinct responsibilities.
 
Product Owner:
* The Product Owner prioritises and manages the product backlog, ensuring that the most valuable features are developed first. 

Scrum Master:
* The Scrum Master facilitates the process, removing obstacles and ensuring that the team adheres to Scrum practices. 
* This role also helps improve team dynamics and communication.
* Daily stand-up meetings, or Scrum meetings, keep everyone aligned by providing a platform for team members to discuss what they did, what they will do , and any obstacles they’re facing. 
      This frequent communication helps in identifying and addressing issues early, which can prevent small problems from escalating into major setbacks.

Development Team:

The development team’s responsibilities include:
* Delivering the work through the sprint.
* To ensure transparency during the sprint they meet daily at the daily scrum ( sometimes called a standup). The daily scrum provides transparency to the work and provides a dedicated place for team members to seek help, talk about success and highlight issues and blockers.

Scrum's iterative approach promotes continuous feedback and adaptation. Regular sprint reviews and retrospectives allow teams to reflect on their work, learn from their experiences, and make necessary adjustments. This iterative cycle fosters a culture of continuous improvement, leading to more efficient processes and higher quality outputs over time.

Overall, Scrum’s emphasis on clear roles, regular communication, iterative progress, and continuous improvement helps IT teams to be more organised, responsive, and productive.


Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

Users:
1. Book readers/borrowers(user)
2. Librarian
3. Admin /Management staff

1. As a Book reader, I want to view detailed information about a book (including availability, summary, and reviews), so that I can decide if it’s the right book for me.
2. As a Reader, I want to notify the library when I return a book, so that my borrowing record is updated and I can avoid late fees.
3.  As a Reader, I want to search for books by title, author, or genre, so that I can find specific books easily.
4. As a Reader, I want to receive notifications about due dates and overdue books, so that I can return or renew them on time.
5. As a Librarian, I want to add, update, or remove books from the catalog, so that the book inventory is accurate and up-to-date.
6. As a librarian, I want to generate reports on book usage, overdue books, and reader activity, so that I can analyse library operations and services.
7. As an administrator, I want to manage user accounts (create, update, or delete accounts), so that I can ensure that only authorised users have access to the system.
8. As an administrator, I want to monitor system performance and usage, so that I can ensure the website is running smoothly and address any issues promptly.
9. As a Reader, I want to view my borrowing history and current loans, so that I can keep track of what I have borrowed and when it is due back.
10. As a User I want to renew book online, So that I can avoid a visit to library.
